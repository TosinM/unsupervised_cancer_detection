Unsupervised Cancer Detection
=========================================================

Unsupervised Cancer Detection (UCD) is a software platform for few-shot learning classifiers from whole-slide imaging datasets. 
Scientists can use the browser-base interface of UCD to select centroids of interest and validate classifiers for patterns like tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes to support tissue-based studies. An approach called *few-shot learning* is used to label the regions that are most closely related
to the given centroid.

Getting Started
===============

Unsupervised Cancer Detection is provided as a collection of Docker images that simplify. Follow the 
:ref:`quick start guide <example-data>` to download and run containers with preloaded sample data and see the section on :ref:`training classifiers <training>`.

For a more detailed overview for Unsupervised Cancer Detection :ref:`system overivew <system-overview>`.
